Nothing crazy actually. Does what the title states. For now, it is quite limited, because I haven't finished it yet. So all it can do is generate a random password with lowercase alphabetic characters, based on the number of characters entered by the user in an input field. I'm going to add more functionalities to it as time goes.

## Most important Functionalities to implement
- Possibility to include uppercase characters []
