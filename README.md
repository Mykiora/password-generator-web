Nothing crazy actually. Does what the title states. For now, it is quite limited, because I haven't finished it yet. So all it can do is generate a random password with lowercase alphabetic characters, based on the number of characters entered by the user in an input field. I'm going to add more functionalities to it as time goes.

### 3-03-2022 but a bunch of hours later
Include uppercases, include numbers and include symbols functionalities added ! I also noticed that I have some issues with responsive, so once I'll be done for good with main functions I will probably have to fix that.

Since I have had poorly managed the CSS, I deleted the file and started writing it again from the beginning. All responsive-relative problems are now solved, and I also added the copy to clipboard functionality.
